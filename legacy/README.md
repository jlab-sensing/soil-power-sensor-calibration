# Legacy Code/Data

The notebook and files here represet data collection and processing for hand measured values. The entire procedure has been updated to be automated with the use of a SMU for providing a variable power source and a teensy to read the analog values from the SPS. This folder serves as an archive for the data collected on only the SPS removing other external variables.
